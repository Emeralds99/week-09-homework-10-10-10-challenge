The guide for this week is based on last week's guide:

https://github.com/SummerOfCode2020/week-06-homework-10-10-10-challenge.

The Mission
Write 10 Functions, 10 Loops, 10 Conditional Statements

The Why
Watching videos, listening to instructors, reading tutorials online, and any actions that do not consist of you writing code will only get you so far. To be a successful programmer, you need lots of daily hands-on practice. Solving lots of code challenges. Work on at least one personal project.

To reach success the fastest, write 10 of each every day. At a minimum, write 10 of each every week.

If you can come up with parts of code for project you would like, use that data and those topics. Do things like define your data in variables, write functions to filter your data, sort your data, summarize and process your data.

In case you are not able to come up with your own project ideas, we have you covered.

In case the sample challenges included here are too easy for you, please work to combine many variables, functions, conditions and object methods together as you can manage.

Instructions
This is basic sample excercies only. There is not solid logic to any of the sample efforts - just fun'ish excercies that require you to write code. Think of these as the "Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti" as singers do, but for programming. Singers do silly but effective practices. Now you do to.
